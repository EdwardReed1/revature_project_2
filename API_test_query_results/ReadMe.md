#### Archive of geoplanet codes (working?)
I found this archive of geoplanet codes which are supposed to be the WOEIDs, but I'm having trouble figuring it out.

- File I used: https://archive.org/details/geoplanet_data_7.10.0.zip [145mb zipped, 882mb uncompressed]
- Site: https://archive.org/search.php?query=geoplanet

#### Sites with good WOEID codes

I believe they get the codes by query the Yahoo weather app and taking the WOEID field.  (reference: https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/documentation.html#woeid)
